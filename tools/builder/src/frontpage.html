                My name is <span style="color:#FCBA04;">Eetu Rantanen</span>, but here on the interwebz I often go by <span style="color:#FCBA04;">XeduR</span>.<br><br>

                I am a jack of all trades. I am a certified data scientist with a couple of years of work experience and I'm a part-time mathematics and statistics lecturer
                at Estonian Business School in Helsinki. However, since you've ended up on this site, you probably know me better as a game developer and a full stack
                web developer, who also dabbles in graphic design, creative writing and all sorts of problem solving.<br><br>

                On this site, you'll find interactive online demos for many of the passion projects that I've created over the years. As passion projects, most of them are related to games.
                The source code for most of these projects is publicly available via <a href="https://github.com/XeduR">my GitHub profile</a> under the MIT License.
                Similarly, you can find the source code for some of my Solar2D plugins at <a href="https://github.com/spyricGames">Spyric's GitHub profile</a>.
                <br><br>
                
                While you don't need to credit me in any way for using my projects, I am always happy to hear when my projects are of help to others.<br>

                I created these <a href="https://solar2d.com/">Solar2D</a> plugins for my company, <a href="https://www.spyric.com/">Spyric</a>, for the sole purpose of making game development faster and easier, or just because I thought they'd be cool or because they'd add something I needed that was missing from Solar2D. Documentations for these plugins is available at <a href="https://www.spyric.com/docs/">Spyric Docs</a>.

                These projects range from individual tables or concepts to more complex functions and systems. Essentially, these projects
                come in all shapes and sizes, but I either didn't consider them big enough or distinct enough to turn them into plugins.

            <h2>Learn Solar2D</h2>
            <p>
                During summer 2021, I will be creating an online course aimed at beginners who wish to learn game development using Solar2D, a free and completely open source game engine.<br><br>
                The course will consist of creating several small incrementally more difficult games while going through each and every step of the process as we go along.<br><br>
