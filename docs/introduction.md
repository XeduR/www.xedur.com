# Introduction

- **Coming Soonâ„¢**<br>
    These docs are still very much under construction. What you see now is just the framework upon which the documentation will be written on and the paragraph below that I copied from one of my GitHub repositories.

If you have ideas for small new projects, troubles with an existing one or if you just want to say hi, you can reach me easily via email at <a href="mailto: eetu.rantanen@spyric.com">eetu.rantanen@spyric.com</a>. I am also active at the <a href="https://forums.coronalabs.com/">Corona forums</a>. Finally, if any of my projects have helped or inspired you, then consider buying me a cup of coffee at <a href="https://ko-fi.com/xedur">Ko-fi</a>.
